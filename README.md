# doll-smuggler by Nathan Ward

## Problem specification:

This project is a solution to the [Atomic Object Clojure coding challenge](https://github.com/micahalles/doll-smuggler). The problem specified for this challenge is not a new one, it is a variant of the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) which is a standard example in computer science literature used to demonstrate principles in dynamic programming and computational complexity. 

The major unique feature of this project is not the  knapsack calculation algorithm itself, rather it is the use of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) for providing information about the dolls and knapsack and for the output of the data from the calculation. 

JSON is often used for transmitting and receiving information from RESTful web API's. This project could feasibly be hosted on a webserver and could be used to provide optimal doll packing advice to clients who access this service.
